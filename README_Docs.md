## Notes on Cloudera documentation

* Cloudera documentation is [available online](http://www.cloudera.com/documentation.html) in HTML and PDF format.
* The site has changed substantially with the C5.7.0 release

I recommend downloading the PDF form of these documents with every
point release. For complex topics that span several pages, I find
them easier to read. The HTML format can be difficult to follow
correctly: there are, in many places:
* Sections describing variations for each Linux distribution
* Sections for using the command line or Cloudera Manager for one exercise
* A variety of `(Optional)` components for long exercises

I find it is easy to get distracted and forget the context of what
you're following. If you're not careful to mark your place and keep
notes on your progress, it's easy to follow instructions that don't
apply to your platform, your chosen approach, or to follow optional
elements you don't need.

For your convenience, I've linked to the latest version of each PDF
below. You won't need many of them for the class, but they don't take much
room on disk:
