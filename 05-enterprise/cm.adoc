=== Cloudera Manager Server Implementation

* Written in Java
* Closed-source
** Hooks & client APIs are link:https://cloudera.github.io/cm_api/[published here]
* Resources:
** C5: `/usr/share/cmf`
** C6: `/opt/cloudera/cm`
* Database initialization scripts:
** C5: `/usr/share/cmf/schema`
** C6: `/opt/cloudera/cm/schema`
* Command-line start parameters: `/etc/default/cloudera-scm-server`

=== Cloudera Manager Agent Implementation

* Written in Python
* Configuration file: `/etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini`
* Resources:
** C5: `/usr/lib64/cmf/agent`
** C6: `/opt/cloudera/cm-agent`
* Process control: `/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent`
** Configuration files for CDH services are located under `process/`
* Uses link:http://supervisord.org/[supervisord] for process control

=== Notes on Cloudera Manager vocabulary

* link:http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2013/07/how-does-cloudera-manager-work/[Philip Zeyliger's blog article on CM's design and operation]
* CM uses link:https://github.com/cloudera/cm_ext/wiki/CSD-Overview[service descriptors] that evolve as features are added
* API resources: link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_intro_api.html[C6.0] (V30)
* Example terms:
** Canary: a smoke test for predictive failure
** Safety valve: edit window to hack in missing/misspelled configuration properties

[[cm_search_bar]]
== CM Search Bar

* Search bar in the upper right expands when selected
* Searching a property name (or colloquial term) returns a `config` link
** Try `dfs.datanode.max.xciever`
** Then try `Transceiver`
* The Configuration tab for a service limits the search context
** Type `locked` into the HDFS Configuration search bar
* Each search result has an object type

=== Search object types

* CM types are also searchable
** `chart`
** `command`
** `config`
** `global`
** `host`
** `link`
** `role`
** `service`

Enter an object type in the search bar

[[users_and_roles]]
== Users and roles

* `Administration -> Users`
** Adding users recommended to differentiate admins
** Supports role-based access limits
* CM defines link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_sg_user_roles.html[twelve roles]
* `Administration -> Users -> Add Users` button
** Select a role to see a description of its scope
** Privileges per role are shown in documentation

[[recent_commands_and_history]]
== Recent commands and history

* `Home -> All Recent Commands`
** Up to 250 current/finished commands per display
** Reports context (service), command status, start and finish times.
* Use the Audits tab to find past events
** Available in home, service, role, and host instance pages
** Time range filter from last 30m to last 30d
** link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cn_iu_audits.html[Several filters available]
* Logs can also be downloaded

[[monitoring_services_and_resources]]
== Monitoring services and resources

* Type `monitor` (or select `Category -> Monitoring`) in the Configuration tab search of any service
* link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_dg_monitoring_settings.html[Serveral types of monitoring settings]
** Health tests - canary and threshold-based
** Free space - threshold-based
** YARN Applications - visibility settings
** Impala Queries - visibility and query data storage
** Alerts
** Log Events

[[adding_alerts]]
== link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_dg_monitoring_settings.html[Adding Alerts]

* `Administration -> Alerts`
* Delivers to email or as SNMP traps
* May be associated with
** Activity Monitor
** Configuration changes (enable/disable only)
** HBase (errors, poor region health)
** Health metric thresholds (*Bad* or *Concerning* result)
** Log messages (regex matching)

[[health_checks]]
== link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_dg_health.html[Health checks]

* Cover services, roles, and hosts
* Two types
** Pass-fail
** link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_metrics.html[Metric] - set to some numeric threshold
** link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_ht.html[Complete health tests list for CM6]
* Condition may be *Good*, *Concerning*, or *Bad*
** Service results may be "rolled up" from subordinate tests (roles, instances)
*** A single Bad or Concerning result affects the whole
** Some metric tests can also be <<charting_metrics, charted>>

[[charting_metrics]]
== Charting metrics (time-series data)

* Charts are searchable by type or name
** Try `canary duration`
* Chart builder and dashboard editor: `CM -> Charts`
** link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.0/topics/cm_dg_chart_time_series_data.html[Documentation]
** A user's collection of charts is called a link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_dg_dashboards.html[dashboard]
* link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_dg_metric_aggregation.html[Metric aggregations]
** metric-timestamp pair + aggregating function (min, max, avg, and stddev)
** Sampling interval is fixed by the monitor (Service or Host)
* Some 'cross-entity' aggregations are available
** E.g., all datanodes in the cluster, all datanodes in one rack
** Aggregate version: `fd_open_across_datanodes, total_fd_open_across_datanodes`

[[managing_property_settings]]
== Managing property settings

* link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_props_top.html[CDH properties by version]
** Organized by service
* link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_props_top.html[Host configuration properties]
** System services, directory free space, etc.
* link:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/properties/6.0/topics/cm_props_cmserver.html[CM Server properties]

[[sample_cm_api_calls]]
== Sample CM API calls

* link:http://cloudera.github.io/cm_api/apidocs/v19/tutorial.html[Tutorials for each version] available
** V30 tutorial not available publicly yet
** All API documentation, including tutorial, is hosted locally by CM at `http://cm_host:7180/static/apidocs/tutorial.html`
** CM versions are link:http://cloudera.github.io/cm_api/docs/releases/[mapped to API versions here]
* Plenty of examples
** link:http://cloudera.github.io/cm_api/docs/quick-start/[With curl]
** link:http://cloudera.github.io/cm_api/docs/python-client/[Using Python]
** link:http://cloudera.github.io/cm_api/docs/java-client/[Java]
* Mark Brooks's script for link:https://github.com/onefoursix/cm-get-ports[listing cluster service ports]
* Other long-range goals with the API
** Scripted CDH install
** Predictive multi-tenancy monitoring, utilization and tuning

[[custom_service_descriptors]]
== Note on link:https://github.com/cloudera/cm_ext/wiki/CSD-Overview[Custom Service Descriptors]

* Cloudera uses parcels to simply adding services via CM
* CSDs integrate the software with Cloudera Manager's feature set
** Monitoring and charting
** Managing resources (Static Service Pools)
** Service lifecycle control
** Publishing service properties
** Assigning services and roles to hosts

** Report the database server in use by CM
* Add these API calls and their output to `05-enterprise/labs/4_API_upgrade_calls.adoc`
* Label the Issue `review`

[[ambari_lab]]
== Ambari Lab

=== Ambari Quiz

_Use Ambari to answer the following questions. For some questions, *the online documentation* will help you. Watch out for trick questions! (Some of these questions have been asked by customers.)  Put the questions and their answers in the file_ `05-enterprise/labs/0_AMBARI_treasure_hunt.adoc`

* What other services/components need also to be upgraded when we upgrade the Ambari server?
* How do you enable an Ambari experimental functionality?
* Use `curl` to get name of the HDP cluster, using Ambari REST API
* Where do you go in Ambari to enable Kerberos?
* Save to the file `labs/1_heatmap.png` a screenshot of a _heatmap_ of the percentage of memory used across all the hosts.
* If you forget the administrator password for Ambari, how to you reset it?
* If the hostname of the Ambari Server is changed, all the hosts in the cluster will stop sending heartbeats to Ambari. What are the steps you need to take to restore the heartbeats.
