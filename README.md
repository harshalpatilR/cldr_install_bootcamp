# <center>Services Enablement Boot Camp 

This repository holds the course materials for Cloudera's Services
Enablement Boot Camp. 

Once you have cloned the materials provided by your instructors, create
your own GitHub repository from it. We recommend following [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/).

Please mark your repository as Private. Doing so allows you to restrict the number of viewers to your work.
You can then add anyone you wish as a Collaborators, including your instructors.

Make the following changes in total:
* Under `Settings -> Collaborators`, add your instructors.
    * You can of course add others as you see fit.
* Under `Settings -> Options`, find the `Features` box. Enable `Issues`.
    * We will use this feature to track progress and address detailed technical questions
* Click the `Issues` tab and the `Milestones` button
    * Create two milestones: `Labs` and `Challenges`
    * You can set their deadlines for Thursday (June 9) and Friday (June 10) if you like.
* Click the `Labels` button and edit your labels as follows:
    * Change `bug` to `labBug `
    * Change `duplicate` to `started`
    * Change `enhancement` to `finished`
    * Change `help wanted` to `graded`
    * Change `invalid` to `blocked`
    * Change `wontfix` to `incomplete`; set the label color to yellow (`#fbca04`).
    * Leave `question` as is

When the course is completed, your repo becomes a record of your
completed assignments, warts and all! You can do whatever you want
after the class; add scripts, annotate, modify as new information
becomes available -- whatever you like.
