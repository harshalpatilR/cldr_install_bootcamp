# <center>Services Enablement Boot Camp 

This repository holds the course materials for Cloudera's FCE Onboarding
Boot Camp. 

To follow the course and submit lab work, you will need to fork the
repo to your own GitHub account (on Cloudera's service). You should
then clone the master repo to your laptop. You will use your clone
of the repo to edit and add files. You will then submit these changes
by committing them to your local repo and pushing them to your fork.

Add your instructors as Collaborators to your fork. This step allows
up to edit your repo directly when necessary. We will only do this
to format your submissions or make other minor changes.

You can add anyone else you like as Collaborators too.

Make the following changes in total:
* You can add collaborators under `Settings -> Collaborators`.
* Under `Settings -> Options`, find the `Features` box and enable `Issues`.
    * We use Issues to track your progress and comment on your work. 
* Click the `Issues` tab and the `Milestones` button
    * Create two milestones, `Labs` and `Challenges`
    * Set the deadlines for Thursday (August 11) and Friday (August 12), respectively.
* Next, click the `Labels` button and edit the labels as follows:
    * Change `bug` to `labBug `
    * Change `duplicate` to `started`
    * Change `enhancement` to `finished`
    * Change `help wanted` to `graded`
    * Leave `invalid` as is
    * Change `wontfix` to `incomplete`; set the label color to yellow (`#fbca04`).
    * Leave `question` as is

When the course is completed, your repo becomes a record of your
completed assignments, warts and all! You can do whatever you want
after the class; add scripts, annotate, modify as new information
becomes available -- whatever you like.
