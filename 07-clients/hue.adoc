* Just a client portal, not a core Hadoop service
** Hue link:http://cloudera.github.io/hue/docs-3.9.0/manual.html[can be set up by anyone]
** In a parcel: `/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hue`
* A cluster can have multiple instances if desired
* Hue does ~~not~~ scale very well, not recommended for >10-15 concurrent users
** You may need multiple instances to support tens of Hue users for one cluster

[[hue_admin_features]]
== HUE Administrative Features

* Hue's database stores user accounts, Hive queries, job submissions
* Embedded database is `SQLite`
* Also supported: link:http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera-content/cloudera-docs/CDH5/latest/CDH5-Requirements-and-Supported-Versions/cdhrsv_db.html[MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle]
* Inspectable: `sqlite3 /var/lib/hue/desktop.db`

== HUE Lab: Authenticate using Linux users/groups

* Use a Linux account with login capability
** Make sure the account has the same UID/GID on all cluster nodes
* link:http://gethue.com/hadoop-tutorial-how-to-integrate-unix-users-and-groups/[Follow this guide]
** You'll need link:http://gethue.com/storing-passwords-in-script-rather-than-hue-ini-files/[these notes] to authenticate to Hue from the command line
* Get a screenshot that shows this user is logged into Hue
** Name the file `client/labs/0_unix_login.png`

== HUE Lab: Security or Availability?

* link:http://gethue.com/apache-sentry-made-easy-with-the-new-hue-security-app/[Integrate Hue and Sentry]
** Watch out for red herring instructions or missing steps
* Install a link:http://gethue.com/automatic-high-availability-and-load-balancing-of-hue-in-cloudera-manager-with-monitoring/[second Hue instance and load balancer]

* Consult with an instructor to get a meaningful screenshot
* Name the screenshot `1_hue_sentry.png` or `1_hue_lb.png`, as appropriate
* If you do both, number the screenshots to show the order you did them.
