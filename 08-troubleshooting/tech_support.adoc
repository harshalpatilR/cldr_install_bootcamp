[[troubleshooting_wisdom]]
== Troubleshooting Wisdom

* *Potential measures by how much you lost* -- my college track coach
* Fixing a recurring or well-known problem quickly is a common pitfall
* You need a method you can recite when you encounter new/unfamiliar territory
* To remind yourself what you know
* To recall tools that can tell you what you don't know
* To remember tools don't solve problems, they help reveal them
* To write down what you've learned so you can share it

[[methodology_guidance]]
== Methodology: Guidance

We have many technologies to consider. A good general-purpose book for articulating your practice is *Debugging*, by David J. Agans. These nine points are the focus:

. Understand the System
. Check the Plug
. Divide and Conquer
. Make It Fail
. Quit Thinking and Look
. Change One Thing at a Time
. Keep an Audit Trail
. Get a Fresh View
. If You Didn't Fix It, It Ain't Fixed

NOTE: Apply #7 to **documenting your fix**, and adding it to the community's knowledge

[[pro_tip_find_patches_by_release]]
== Pro Tip: Find Patches by Release

* Review the link:http://archive-primary.cloudera.com/cdh5/cdh/5/[change log]
* Search by link:http://jira.cloudera.com[CDH project] -- put JIRA identifier in double quotes
* Grep the code! For example, to find FLUME-2245 in CDH 5.1.x:
+
[source]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudera/flume-ng
$ cd flume-ng
$ git branch -a
$ git log origin/cdh5-1.4.0_5.0.2 | grep 'FLUME-2245'
$ git log origin/cdh5-1.4.0_5.0.3 | grep 'FLUME-2245'
FLUME-2245. Pre-close flush failure can cause HDFS Sinks to not process events
----
* Getting patch updates: `git fetch origin`

[[pro_action_finding_patches_with_better_tools]]
== Pro Action: Finding Patches with Better Tools

* Fork/review Jarcec Cecho's link:https://github.com/jarcec/cmd-tools/blob/master/gb-grep[gb-grep tool]
** Doesn't require branch-specific search
* Example usage:
+
[source]
----
$ git clone http://github.com/apache/hadoop.git
$ cd hadoop/
$ gb-grep "HDFS-7575"
----
* Sample output line:
